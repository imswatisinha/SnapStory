SnapStory is an AI-powered application that transforms your images into engaging stories and narrates them for you! Upload up to 10 images, pick your favorite genre, and let the AI generate and narrate a unique story inspired by your visuals.

## Features

- **Image-to-Story Generation:**  
  Upload 1 to 10 images (PNG, JPG, JPEG), and SnapStory will analyze them to create a coherent narrative connecting all images in the order provided.

- **Genre Selection:**  
  Choose from multiple storytelling styles, including:
  - Comedy
  - Thriller
  - Fairy Tale
  - Sci-Fi
  - Mystery
  - Adventure
  - Morale

- **Indian Context:**  
  All stories are written with Indian names, characters, places, and cultural context.

- **Special Genre Sections:**  
  Some genres include unique conclusions:
    - **Morale:** A `[MORAL]:` section at the end of the story delivering the lesson.
    - **Mystery:** A `[SOLUTION]:` section that reveals the culprit and the key clue.
    - **Thriller:** A `[TWIST]:` section with a final, shocking twist.

- **AI Narration:**  
  After generating the story, SnapStory uses AI-based text-to-speech to narrate the story in English. Listen to your story directly in the app.

- **Interactive & Easy to Use:**  
  - Simple Streamlit web interface.
